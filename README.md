# ABC80 AIRFIGHT 1981
A recreated program/code from paper for the ABC80 from 1981 inspired by Atari 2600 Combat #24.

Kristian Lidberg did the main code and I (to a small degree) contributed. We were at the time in
the gymnasium (Br√§nnkyrka gymnasium, Stockholm), in 1981. As you might recognize, it is not very
consistent and flawed. We were alternating by the keyboard under some pressure to complete this
(including nights), so there are naturally a lot of those flaws.
I guess at maximum we might have done this in a few weeks, or more probably in some days.

It was really only once ever used, during an afternoon when parents visited the school.
It also depends on two "joysticks" which were connected to the V24-port at the back. They were
in the same spirit as Atari made them: simple switches, and for each a "fire button".

It has never been published, until now, partly because we were probably afraid of possible
copyright infringment. That is why it is called AIR-FIGHT and not Combat (#24), or something
like that.
