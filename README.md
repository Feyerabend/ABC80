# ABC80 AIR-FIGHT 1981
A recreated program/code from paper trail.
Originally coded for the [ABC80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_80) in 1981,
inspired by [Atari VCS/2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) [Combat #24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_(Atari_2600)).

**U. Kristian Lidberg** did the main code in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)
and I (to a small degree) contributed. We were at the time in
the gymnasium ([Br√§nnkyrka gymnasium](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A4nnkyrka_gymnasium),
Stockholm, Sweden), in 1981. As you might recognize, it is not very
consistent and flawed. We were alternating by the keyboard under some pressure to complete this
(including nights), so there are naturally a lot of those flaws. I guess at maximum we might have
done this in a few weeks, or more probably in some days.

It was really only once ever used, during an afternoon when parents visited the school.
It also depends on two "joysticks" which were connected to the V24-port [RS232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232)
at the back, were tailormade by us.
We built them from small hotel soap containers, where the inside had cables, switches and diodes.
They were in the same spirit as Atari made them: simple switches, and for each a "fire button".
The keyboard was no alternative because the keyboard roll-over was to limited.
I did a poster, which was an illustration of two fighting aeroplanes.

It has never been published, until now, partly because we were probably afraid of possible
copyright infringment at the time. That's why it's also called "AIR-FIGHT" rather than "Combat (#24)".

There might be spelling mistakes, as I have not tried to run this code at all.

It has finally been put here as a remeberance of Kristian, as he disappeared without trace in the mid 80'ties,
never to return.
