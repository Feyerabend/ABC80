## A note on historical contexts

History can be written in many ways. This includes the history of technology
and computer science. One way of looking at things relates to often the context
in which something appeared. Let's take the "western" type of keyboard layout
which many of us are used to: the *qwerty* keyboard.[^qwerty]

An argument of *why* we have this might not be as interesting as the question
of why it became som *popular and wide spread*. The question of why can be
construed in hindsight (even contrafactual), and might not be the actual
reason (or in case: reasons) for why it became to be so popular. The reason,
it could be argued, the keyboard layout was due to technical reasons, as the
(maybe overlapping) typebars should not collide to often (as the often used
keys are spread out). Those of us who have typed on an ordinary typewriter
may agree to this, and draw the immediate conclusion that this must have
*caused* the layout to be the still dominant way of manufacturing keyboards today.
This historical "hunt" for such causal relationships may or may not be the
actual case, naturally. But, perhaps, rather than internal arguments, we
could look for emergence of *streams of technological innovation* where
some find their way through the changing landscape and derive larger and
larger streams, but where others stops and go no futher.
To keep with the analogy, success (or failure) might *not* have to do with the
strength of the stream itself from the start, but may very well have to do
with the form of the landscape, hills and valleys, soft and hard ground, and
add to this the constant change through time (which deviates from the impervious
landscape).

We can thus speculate in the historical success of "qwerty" as the result
of a lot of 'things' influencing its path. One of these influences can be
the technological reason mentioned above. But it not even be *the* reason.
