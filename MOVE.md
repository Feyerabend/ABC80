# Shift the focus of education!

The imminent or ongoing mass education of the Swedish people in
schools, study associations, etc., seem to mainly focus on the programming
of computers, preferably in the BASIC programming language. To some
extent also taken into account societal aspects, consequences and the
current use within the computer range. My thesis then is that the centre
of gravity is incorrect and should be moved so that a generally suitable
and more satisfactory teaching can happen. The risk -- as I see it -- is
otherwise that people think they understand that which passes them by.
This will be investigated in more detail below.

People are now mainly trained in how to program, abstractly program
construction, etc., enough for them to be able to manufacture their own
program of simple type. What happens is that they have to learn how to adapt
to the computer to adapt the computer to themselves. This procedure is at
present very cumbersome and time-consuming, especially after the short
experience the course provides. Note well the development of programming
languages; intuitively constructed structures, versions in step with the
change in the architecture of the computer at large, without fixed theoretical
control of, for example, semantics. Moreover, it is possibly so that what they
have learned is or can be something highly temporary. For example, if the future
development turns out to have such a rapid course, that within a few years much
of the learned knowledge is of no real value.

Thus, for the vast majority, the education appears to be somewhat distorted
vision, which can have a harmful impact instead of the opposite purpose.
This is particularly evident in short-term education. But it can sure to be
very instructive to the few who will deal with it professionally, or otherwise
comes into intimate contact with the computer.

What should happen is that a more general education can be offered to those
people who will not be using the computer in direct programming in the short term.
It should furthermore, have an even balance between the internal and the external.
With the former I understand everything that is concrete, directly connected to
the computer by both hardware and software. In the latter I want to include everything
that does not is internal, but of course relevant relative to the computer. This
includes e.g the consequences of computerization (officerization, robotization, etc.).
The training should also pay attention to the early stages of development and use.
To concisely summarise the above hints is a possible educational
content and goals: the past, present and future of both the external and
the internal, in terms of development and use.

Perhaps this described training seems inappropriate in practice, but let me
then comment another possible improvement to the already existing one. Herbert
Söderström has previously given expression to such, where he mentions how the
method because learning can change.

When elementary teaching of a programming language takes place, its syntactic and
semantic qualities up, through often already constructed and working examples
and partly programs made by the students themselves. They are expected further in a
considerable speed to acquire and understand this. Very little of the time is devoted
to ascertain whether this has really happened. But the education can get a whole
different character as we also see that the programs' behaviour changes through
changes in atomic functions. My intention here is not that, but what HS
tends to, that tests and corrections etc. in programs should become some main task.
I also do not believe that programming languages should in any way become natural,
such as they are out today. But only so that the specific behaviour of the programming
language is made sufficiently comprehensible, comprehensible. Allowing the students to
change a certain instrument, may well be pedagogically more evident than showing all
individuals details, parts with which you can, for example, build this. From the above
understand we why an education, where we concentrate on the computer as a structure but
not as a model as well as a levelling of the interest of the total, will be
a suitable alternative. Thus the conclusion is a direction towards the previous 
proposed training.
